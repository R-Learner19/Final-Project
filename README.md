# Final Project: Disability and Marijuana Usage in the BRFSS 2024
Significance for Study 
I. In 2022, over 70 million adults in the U.S. reported having a disability (CDC, 2024). 
II. The disabled community is one that anyone can join at any point in time, whether permanently or temporarily. 
Studying this population provides key insights that may be used to inform policy, interventions, and illuminate solutions for accessibility. This would provide a better quality of life for millions of people. 
III. Knowledge production
While research on disability and marijuana usage exists, few studies have focused on disability type and marijuana use (Grimm et al., 2023).
IV. No research using BRFSS 2024 data has been found regarding this topic.

Purpose of Project
I. To assess whether different types of disabilities influence marijuana use among respondents of the 2024 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)?
